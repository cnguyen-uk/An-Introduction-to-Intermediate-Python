# An Introduction to Intermediate Python
*A compact introduction to some intermediate Python concepts*

Python is one of the most popular programming languages in the world and is commonly learnt as a first programming language. As such, there are an abundance of courses, books and videos on learning basic Python.

Rather than simply being another guide on basic Python, this one aims to present some intermediate Python concepts in a compact way for someone who is already familiar with the basics of functional programming in Python.

Note that this guide is for Python 3, but can easily be translated into Python 2.
